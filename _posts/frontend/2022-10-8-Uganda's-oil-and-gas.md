After a long period of waiting since the first oil discovery in 2006, Uganda is now set to see its first oil in 2025. This discovery of Ugandaâ€™s oil came at a time when fossil fuels face the most criticism in the history of the Energy sector due to the Climate change crisis. In addition to that, the ratification of agreements like the 2016 Paris Agreement on climate change is slowly but surely shaping the energy sector, encouraging the transition from Oil and gas to cleaner energy.


Today, global oil and gas giants are acquiring and investing in energy technologies like biofuel, hydrogen power, carbon capture and storage (CCUS), and convenience retail including charging for electric vehicles to contribute to energy sustainability. Companies such as Shell and Total Energies aim for around half of their sales to come from low- or no-carbon products and storage by 2025 and 2050 respectively. 


The criticism against fossil fuels has not spared the development of oil and gas in Uganda with campaigns against the 1445 km long crude oil pipeline (EACOP) from Uganda to Tanzania. However, due to the challenging times, the government of Uganda and the oil companies have affirmed their commitment to sustainably develop the oil and gas sector with an emphasis to protect the environment. Today, tree planting campaigns such as the ROOTs campaign to plant 1 million trees a day till 2026, and the Tilenga Biodiversity program to plant 100,000 trees in the Tilenga project areas of Nwoya and Buliisa districts have taken the pace to restore forest cover in the Country.


As Uganda starts to produce its first oil (currently known as 6.5 billion barrels of hydrocarbons in place), significant revenue is anticipated to come into the economy. This will be through the sale of crude oil and refined products. If this revenue is directed to other sectors of the economy like agriculture, education, infrastructure, and green energy sources, there will be a greater chance for the country to achieve a sustainable energy future.
