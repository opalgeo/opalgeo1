After a long period of waiting since the first oil discovery in 2006, Uganda is now set to see its first oil in 2024. Unfortunately, the discovery of Ugandaâ€™s oil came at a time when fossil fuels face the most criticism in history of the Energy sector due to the Climate crisis. The ratification of agreements like the 2016 Paris Agreement on climate change are slowly but surely shaping the energy sector, encouraging the phase out of the Oil and gas while advocating for clean energy transition.  


The criticism against fossil fuels has not spared the development of oil and gas in Uganda with campaigns against the 1445 km long crude oil pipeline (EACOP) from Uganda to Tanzania. However, due to the challenging times, the government of Uganda and the oil companies have affirmed their commitment to sustainably develop the oil and gas sector with emphasis to protect the Environment. Today, tree planting campaigns such as the ROOTs campaign to plant 1 million trees a day till 2026, and the Tilenga Biodiversity program to plant 100,000 trees in the Tilenga project areas of Nwoya and Buliisa districts have taken pace to restore forest cover in the Country.


As Uganda starts to produce her currently known 6.5 bbl. of Hydrocarbons, a significant revenue is expected to come from the sale of the crude oil and the refined products as well. Such revenue if directed to other sectors of the Economy such as Agriculture, Education, Infrastructure, and green Energy sources like Hydro-power, Biofuel, solar, wind and nuclear power can provide an opportunity for the Country to achieve a green Economy in the shorted time.
