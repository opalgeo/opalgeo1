As of today, Uganda has an estimated 6.5 billion barrels (bbl.) of oil equivalent in place, with about 1.4 bbl of these resources recoverable. This gives an average recovery factor (RF) of 23.3% of the oil in place which falls within the global average RF of 20 to 30% using the available technologies. The oil RF depends on several geological factors, including reservoir porosity and permeability, reservoir pressure and depth, oil type, clay content, and formation water salinity, among others. Enhanced Oil Recovery (EOR) methods are often applied to increase the amount of oil recovered after the natural drive (primary recovery) mechanisms become insufficient. EOR techniques used include water flooding, thermal flooding, gas injection, alkaline and polymer flooding.


According to the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Development Uganda report 2019, polymer flooding and water flooding are the EOR methods being considered for the fields in the Albertine graben. Laboratory experiments have put polymer flooding as a favorite EOR method with higher recovery compared to water flooding. Studies carried out on Kingfisher field by CUL; Ngiri, Jobi-Rii, and Gunya fields by TEPU, and Kasamene, Wahrindi, Mputa, and Waraga fields by TUOP showed an increased recovery in the range of 3-10%, which translates to about 232 million barrels of oil.


The most commonly used polymers include polyacrylamide, partially hydrolyzed polyacrylamide, and Xanthan. Field application of polymer flooding showed a significant increase in the recovery of heavy oils by 12-15% in China. However, polymers can be retained in the reservoir pore throat through precipitation, adsorption, and/or mechanical entrapment causing severe and permanent damage to the formation. This damage is only noticed after a long period of field operation when a significant amount of resources are already wasted. The damage that reduces the reservoir permeability leads to a lower recovery factor without any alternative EOR methods to be considered. 


Therefore, the Petroleum Authority of Uganda (PAU) must ensure that the national and international oil companies consider field tests for polymer flooding before implementing the full field EOR project.
