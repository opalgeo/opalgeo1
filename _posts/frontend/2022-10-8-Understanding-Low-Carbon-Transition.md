There are soaring concerns about climate change as one of the major drives towards a low-carbon emissions economy. If the world is to come anywhere near to meeting its climate-change goals, the oil and gas industry will have to play a big part. The Oil and gas sector is often painted the dirtiest within the energy industry and thus major companies have begun to develop renewable energy in a bid to clean up the economy. The industry’s operations account for 9 percent of all human-made greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions while directly and indirectly, it accounts for over 44% of the global emissions.  


The idea of transition suggests movement over time from one set of circumstances to another. Low-carbon transition extremists would look at it as decarbonizing the economy entirely, but in a realistic sense, it is eliminating energy sources emitting high levels of greenhouse gas. There are quite several forces coming into play to drive the oil companies and the world at large toward low-carbon emissions according to Beck et al. (2020): The ratification of the Kyoto Protocol, Paris Agreement, and the likes; Sharpened investors’ interest in sustainable and resilient assets, including renewables; Activist shareholders challenging oil majors on their climate policies and emissions-reduction plans; Renewable technologies getting cheaper with both photovoltaics (PV) and utility-scale fallen more than 70% since 2011; Carbon taxes or Carbon trading systems; UN Climate Summit, an alliance of the world’s largest pension funds and insurers (representing about $2.4 trillion in assets) committing itself to transit its portfolios to net-zero emissions by 2050, etc.

Critically reflecting on the words of Matthias Pickl, Oil firms are essentially attempting to figure out how the best presently available cash cow in the world can be replaced for the benefit of their sustainable future. We must appreciate that generally; the low-carbon transformation of oil companies is still in its infancy. Aspects of technology, organizational integration, investment portfolios, and rethinking operating models are some of the action plans by Oil and gas companies in response to this low-carbon emission transformation path.

To analyze transition by theory, we define the low-carbon transition as structural economic change: some parts of the economy grow and others decline in relative importance majorly as a result of deliberate policy, changing preferences, and ongoing technological change. To meet emissions-reduction targets, low-carbon sunrise industries must grow rapidly as high-carbon sunset industries decline equally at the same rate which is just ideal from a realist viewpoint. Perhaps relevant to the discussion is the Marxist crisis theory that builds on Karl Marx's charge to technology and innovation as explaining the social-technical change. Then Marx's differentiation of the economy explains how both under consumption (shift of demand to renewable energy alternatives) and over-investment can generate a crisis and collapse. The Schumpeterian theory of the business cycle can further help us understand how innovative sunrise industries like renewable alternatives and more productive technologies cause creative destruction and abandonment of prevailing industries such as high-carbon sectors. Howbeit, Real business cycle theory models like what oil companies should intrinsically bear, shock industries from technological change, sunrising alternative, etc.

Reputational resilience and the potential for financial outperformance remains major objective for oil companies. As the physical risks from a changing climate are better understood, transition risks such as societal pressure, technological disruption, and shifting consumer preferences become more widespread. Financial resilience is increasingly becoming a function of climate resilience. Investors, activists, and analysts challenge the contribution of oil and gas companies to a changing climate. Demands for oil companies to eliminate greenhouse gas emissions across the entire value chains are growing. In response, oil and gas companies are also building portfolios and investment plans that are resilient.
