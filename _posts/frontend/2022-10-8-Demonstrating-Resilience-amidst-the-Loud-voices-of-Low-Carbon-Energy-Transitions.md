In recent years, the global energy landscape has been changing. Traditional energy is gradually decreasing while renewable energy is developing rapidly. The oil and gas industry has found itself with barely any alternative but to rather respond to the low-carbon emission energy transition to keep afloat. 

Although the global energy demand is significantly increasing, and oil & gas continue to account for more than half of the energy market, the increasing global focus on clean energy to deal with environmental problems will dictate how Oil companies do business. Climate change is already threatening society through altered patterns of extreme weather events and impacts on critical ecosystems. The world has thus, adopted global climate targets and laws requiring carbon neutrality with emissions cuts of 80–95% by 2050. The 2016 Paris agreement has enshrined the need to stabilize temperature increases below 2°C of the pre-industrial levels. Thus to become a low-emission society, decarbonization of the energy system is crucial. 

Most big oil and gas companies have recognized the importance of low-carbon transition earlier enough and began to take action. They have gone deliberate on environmental protection while focusing on improving economic efficiency. Notwithstanding this transition to an ambitious low-carbon industry, the Oil & Gas companies world over, including the ones operating in the Albertine Graben (Uganda) are expected to prove their economic and reputational resilience collectively as they continue to operate in this overly criticised energy terrain. The idea of a decarbonized economy will continue to shape the sector and thus going forward Oil majors are keen on reducing emissions as a prime consideration of on their To-do list so as to stay afloat!
