There is no doubt that technological advancement plays an irreplaceable role in the low-carbon transition of oil and gas companies. In this transition, several large oil and gas companies have taken action and it can be seen that from a technical perspective, many oil companies are involved in low-carbon projects.As most companies focus on a gradual shift to renewable energy development, other oil and gas companies focus on improving energy efficiencies.

Developing and utilizing renewable energy is still thought of as the most thorough way to achieve a low-carbon transition yet the most difficult to achieve. Some oil companies began to incorporate renewable energy into their future development long ago, while some oil and gas companies remain on the sidelines. The development of renewable energy is currently focused on geothermal energy, solar energy, wind energy, and bioenergy. Such companies have rich experience in the application of geothermal energy whose development is relatable to Oil and gas. Some oil companies use solar energy instead of natural gas to generate steam for enhanced oil recovery.

But besides renewable technologies, Oil companies are generally using and investing in emerging technologies such as Carbon Capture, Utilization, and Storage (CCUS), Vent gas recycling technology, Carbon dioxide flooding technology, Gas hydrate technology, Energy-related technique Energy storage technology, Geothermal energy utilization technology, Distributed energy technology, Biomass energy development technology, Rapid charging technology, Energy system optimization technology, Management techniques, Block chain technology, Artificial intelligence, Energy Internet, Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) to help customers reduce their carbon emissions.

Taking a prognosis of current Technology to forecast its future, Information technology, and high-tech will continue to promote the low-carbon transformation to a greater extent in the oil and gas industry. Digitalization and intellectualization are also the development trends for the future and experts believe that digital oilfields will increase the net present value of oil and gas assets by 25%, reduce operating and personnel costs by 25%, and increase production by 5%. As a result, many software companies will continue positioning themselves to provide digital solutions for the low-carbon transition. The future is probably now and so Oil majors should embrace technological transformation as early as this morning if they are to withstand and thrive in the face of unanticipated shocks arising from the global push for the energy transition.
